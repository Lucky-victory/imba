## Select

`ui-select` is implemented as an event modifier.

- One reason for this is not having to mount the select menu manually.

- Another is not having to pass the event target as the anchor for floating ui manually.

You can also still mount it manually if you want.

`ui-select` takes a list of items and an options object.
You can supply a getter named `cb` to the options object.
If no getter function is supplied, `ui-select` will assume it was passed a list of strings.
Otherwise, it will call the getter to get the string to display each item.

```imba
tag app

	items = ["hello", "world", "hi"]
	item = items[0]

	<self>
		css inset:0 d:hts

		<button bind=item @click.select(items)> item

imba.mount <app>
```

Available `opts`:

- `pos`: corresponds to https://floating-ui.com/docs/tutorial#placements
- `offset`: corresponds to https://floating-ui.com/docs/offset#__next
- `searchable`: a boolean describing whether the menu is searchable or not. Defaults to yes.

## Notes

If you are using `bind` to set a variable to the result of the select,
binding buttons in imba already has custom toggling behavior and will
show "true" or "false" until the promise returns. In this case,
you should use a custom element instead of an actual button.
